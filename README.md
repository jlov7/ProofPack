## What ProofPack Does

ProofPack turns an AI agent run into a portable evidence bundle:

- ordered event log
- per-event policy decisions
- RFC 6962 Merkle audit tree
- Ed25519 signed receipt
- optional trust store, timestamp anchor, append-only history, and threshold signatures
- selective disclosure commitments for public sharing

A verifier can inspect the pack offline. No ProofPack server is trusted. The math checks out or it does not.

## 60-Second Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jlov7/ProofPack.git
cd ProofPack
pnpm install
pnpm demo
pnpm verify -- examples/sample_runs/latest.proofpack
```

Expected result:

```text
ProofPack Verification Report
VERIFIED
```

Launch the workbench:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), select **Try demo pack**, then inspect report, timeline, proofs, policy, disclosure, and exports.

## Pack Format

```text
.proofpack/
├── manifest.json
├── receipt.json
├── events/
│   └── events.jsonl
├── policy/
│   ├── policy.yml
│   └── decisions.jsonl
└── audit/
    ├── merkle.json
    └── inclusion_proofs/
        └── {event_id}.json
```

Redacted public projections replace event payloads with `payload_commitment` and record derivation metadata in the receipt block:

```json
{
  "kind": "redaction_projection",
  "source_run_id": "...",
  "source_receipt_sha256": "...",
  "payload_mode": "payload_commitments",
  "signer_policy": "unsigned_projection"
}
```

Unsigned projections are schema `1.0.0` derived artifacts. They are independently checkable for manifest, Merkle, policy, and disclosure integrity, but they do not claim to be a new producer attestation unless a configured redaction signer is supplied.

## Interfaces

### CLI

```bash
pnpm verify -- examples/sample_runs/latest.proofpack
pnpm verify -- examples/sample_runs/latest.proofpack -- --json
pnpm verify -- examples/sample_runs/latest.proofpack -- --profile strict --trust-store config/trust-store.example.json
pnpm diff -- examples/sample_runs/latest.proofpack examples/sample_runs/latest.proofpack
```

### Web Workbench

The Next.js workbench supports:

- standard, strict, and permissive verification profiles
- trust-store JSON validation
- failure explainers and next-step hints
- timeline inspection
- signature and Merkle proof views
- public disclosure generation
- compliance report exports

### API

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/demo-pack --output demo.proofpack.zip
curl -F "file=@demo.proofpack.zip" http://localhost:3000/api/verify
curl -F "file=@private.proofpack.zip" http://localhost:3000/api/redact --output public.proofpack.zip
```

API errors use a stable shape:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "ZIP_SLIP",
    "message": "Zip entry escapes extraction root"
  }
}
```

## Verification Checks

| Check                  | What it proves                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `manifest.schema`      | Manifest and receipt match supported schema versions                                                            |
| `receipt.signature`    | Receipt block was signed by the stated Ed25519 key, or explicitly unsigned for a schema 1.0.0 public projection |
| `receipt.trust`        | Optional signer trust-store requirements pass                                                                   |
| `merkle.root`          | Event bytes produce the signed Merkle root                                                                      |
| `merkle.inclusion_all` | Every event has a valid inclusion proof                                                                         |
| `policy.hash`          | Policy and decisions match the signed hashes                                                                    |
| `disclosure.openings`  | Optional openings reveal exactly the committed payloads                                                         |
| `timestamp.anchor`     | Optional timestamp evidence is valid and not before creation                                                    |
| `history.consistency`  | Optional append-only history reference is consistent                                                            |

## Architecture

```text
agent runtime
    │ structured events
    ▼
@proofpack/core
    ├─ policy evaluation
    ├─ canonical JSON
    ├─ Merkle tree
    ├─ signing and verification
    ├─ disclosure commitments
    └─ hardened archive parsing
    │
    ├─ @proofpack/cli
    ├─ @proofpack/api
    └─ @proofpack/web
```

Core verification is shared by CLI, API, and web. The delivery surface changes, the proof logic does not.

## Security Model

ProofPack detects tampering after capture. It does not prove that every real-world action was captured. For stronger capture guarantees, pair it with runtime instrumentation, kernel audit logs, sandbox telemetry, or hardware-backed attestation.

Primary defenses:

- RFC 8785 canonicalization before signing
- RFC 6962 domain-separated Merkle hashing
- Ed25519 signatures with optional multisig threshold
- trust-store validation and key lifecycle metadata
- zip-slip, entry-count, decompressed-size, and compression-ratio guards
- selective disclosure commitments with random salts

Read the full model in [docs/SECURITY.md](./docs/SECURITY.md) and [docs/security/threat-model-2026-03.md](./docs/security/threat-model-2026-03.md).

## Status

ProofPack is pre-1.0. The core verifier is already heavily tested, but public APIs and pack compatibility should still be treated as release-candidate quality until the v1.0 tag.
